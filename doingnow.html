                        <h2>C4 Placement</h2>
                        <p>For the 2022-2023 school year I am participating in York University's C4 placement program. C4 is the Cross-Campus Capstone Classroom, in which students work in multi-disciplinary teams to engage in project-based placement. In groups, students work closely with community partners on a project that creates change within their organization. For this C4 term, the group I am in will be partnering with Irma Coulson Public School Public School to address the challenge question "How can Grade 6 students promote environmental education in their local community?"</p>

                        <p> April 2023 UPDATE: This project is now in its end stage. The team is working closely with our project partners to finalize our deliverables, which include kits for the students to create their own self-watering gardens, and an accompanying workbook with information about sustainability, Indigenous gardening practices, and food justice. </p>
                        
                        <p>For more information about this project, check out the team's Community Impact video:</p>

                        <h2>WRIT4003 Organizational Writing Practicum 2022-2023</h2>

                        <p>For my organizational writing course practicum, I worked closely with my classmates to form a communications consultancy called Key Point Communications (KPC). KPC had two clients during the duration of this practicum course. Our first client was the York-TD Community Engagement Centre.</p>

                        <p>KPC members worked to research, create, and conduct a business plan seminar for this client. We also created promotional materials for the seminar, along with additional handouts for attendees. The client was pleased with the depth of our research, the quality of our presentation skills, and the amount of participants in attendance.</p>
                        
                        <p>KPC's second client was the York University Library (YUL). We were tasked with creating a communications plan for this client, and we presented them with an in-depth plan on how to best promote their values, and a presentation explaining our recommendations. YUL were happy to receive our communications plan, and complimented the depth of our research.</p>
